Let me give you a walkthrough on how I implemented this project and how I came up with ideas in detecting the churn rate using Machine Learning.

Since Churn rate is a massive problem, it's equally important to detect the churn rate monthly or annually as well. In every telecom company, there will be a team assigned to take up the task.

Let's dive right into the topic of Machine Learning.
Before that, what is Machine Learning? 
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

There are 2 types of approach in Machine Learning. 1. Supervised Learning 2. Unsupervised Learning.
Under Supervised ML, there are 2 sub categories such as 1. Regression Model 2. Classification Model.
    * In regression model, the output is CONTINUOUS (Weather forcast in LA=11.5C, height of a student=170.8cm)
    * In classification model, the output is DISCRETE (No. of cars=5, No of students in class=34)
Types of Regression Model:
          1. Linear Regression
          2. Decision Trees
          3. Random Forest
          4. Neural network
Types of Classification Model:
          1. Logistic Regression
          2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
          3. Naive Bayes
          4. Decision Trees
          5. Random Forest
          6. Neural network

Under Unsupervised ML, there are 2 sub categories such as 1. Clustering 2. Dimensionality Reduction.

To perform "Telecom-Churn", I opted Supervised Machine Learning. Go on and read the code...
